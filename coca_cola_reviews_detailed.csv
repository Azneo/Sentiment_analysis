Dave,AU,Found a leaking can in my 30 can‚Ä¶,"Found a leaking can in my 30 can purchase which leaked onto my carpet and stained it, I phoned coke and spoke with one of their reps. Because the cans were out of date they wouldn‚Äôt entertain me. Firstly I understand that the product would (in theory) taste better before the use by date, but surely the manufacturing process would ensure the the cans would last at least double the usable time (coke told me 1 year for the best before date from manufacture) I am not disputing the taste of the coke (although I can‚Äôt tell any difference) I believe the cans should last longer. If it wasn‚Äôt a manufacturing flaw, why have all the remaining cans not leaked. Why is it that I have never had a Pepsi can leak, only Coke cans. Hey Coke, why not have a best before date of 1 month, then you would never have to fulfil any complaints. Not happy",4 days ago,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/67ee290674626a453f55ec7c

Shelly J,US,When Coca-Cola travels for business they‚Äôre too big for their britches,"I used to enjoy their products, however I worked for a hotel and people from Coca-Cola came to stay for business. From walking in the door to departure, they were extremely rude including the vice president. They acted like they rented out the entire hotel instead of a few rooms. They felt entitled to request things get moved around in the communal areas multiple times and made a list for the general manager. For example, we had a Coca-Cola fridge (the hotel owns it) and they wanted us to change out the drinks displayed in there since they weren‚Äôt all Coca-Cola brand. They demanded we only hand out their branded water and have them in all the rooms during their stay (and not just their rooms. All of them!). The vice president also felt the need to violate our property rules. His assistant yelled at the security officer for doing their job asking him not to smoke his cigar in the courtyard (he insisted on doing this nightly). The next week we had a different soda brand come in for business and they did not act this way. They acted normal. Coca-Cola forgot that while they were there, they were acting under their brand. As a consumer, I have been vocal about their behavior and will support any other soda company.Date of experience is rough estimate.","Nov 27, 2024",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/67466f6fe24a7c0aebabb31f
courtnee,AU,Coca-Cola,"Coca-Cola, the world's most recognizable brand, is a prime example of how misleading marketing can mask a product's harmful effects. While it may offer a temporary burst of sweet satisfaction, the long-term consequences of its consumption are far from pleasant.Here's why you should think twice before reaching for that cold can of Coca-Cola:Sugar Bomb: A single can of Coca-Cola packs a shocking amount of added sugar, contributing to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.Tooth Decay Nightmare: The high sugar content and acidic nature of Coca-Cola wreak havoc on your teeth, leading to cavities, erosion, and weakened enamel.Dehydration Danger: Despite its liquid form, Coca-Cola can actually dehydrate your body due to its diuretic effect.Empty Calories: Coca-Cola provides little to no nutritional value, leaving you feeling hungry and unsatisfied.Addiction Potential: The combination of sugar and caffeine in Coca-Cola can be addictive, making it difficult to break free from its grip.In conclusion, while Coca-Cola may be a nostalgic favorite for many, it's time to recognize its negative impact on our health. Opt for healthier alternatives like water, herbal tea, or fresh fruit juice to nourish your body and protect your future.","Nov 26, 2024",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/673e68136e5f82a5ff90ccff
Connie,GB,Overpriced products that have significantly dropped in quality,"Coca-Cola is no longer carbonated enough and so goes flat when it's only been open a short amount of time. It's worse with the plastic bottles but still an issue with the cans. I used to drink a lot of Coke but now it always goes flat before I finish a bottle, or even a can. Lowering the quality but increasing the price to extortionate amounts is unethical and as the customer, you feel ripped off.Also the big bottles are now clearly made cheaply and are now flimsy, make them easier to spill when pouring, especially for people with motor issues. The new caps are a nightmare to get back on, again especially for disabled people but even for those without issues with their grip.","Nov 25, 2024",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/66eee7ce0f9f4a5da47bd3d8

It did not happen overnight obviously, but you know, it is like a tradition and a safe choice for a lot of people when it comes to soft drinks. I like to enjoy a light coke every now and then. It's that perfect combination of sweetness and the fizz that give you the tingling sensation when it goes down your throat.and It's not even the taste, it is about the adaptation, it is ""familiar"" so it has become like a comfort beverage for me.

Michelle,GB,"Crazy, stupid new Lid debacle","I am not sure what bright spark decides to make the lids unattachable on your bottles,  but it is literally the worst idea ever. It is nye on impossible to get the lid back on securely without leaks and if you do manage it, trying to close it tightly results in skin cuts from the jagged Lid attachments.  I don't know why you are trying to invent the wheel, it was not broken, so why try and fix it.  There was absolutely no issue with the detachable lids previously.  It is an extremely poor show and needs to revert to the original design asap. Crazy, useless invention that causes damage to the user and you are going to end up with claims for cuts and lacerations.  Time for a major rethink and putting right what was never wrong","Jul 9, 2023",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5645e1250000ff0001ea7aaa
Luis Alvarez,ES,New cap. Is a bad design!,"The new cap for the large bottles is a really poor design. It doesn't allow you to close the bottle tight. So if you open a new bottle in the evening and by morning the cola is flat as a pancake. If you try and tighten it well and make sure it's closed. It snaps and doesn't allow you to close the bottle at all.  So wasteful. Sick of wasting money. So I just bought a soda stream. The bottle cap closes properly and if it's flat I can pop it in the carbonator and re fizz it. Also why are you still using PLASTIC when glass is better. Have the super markets charge a deposit , and we return them to the store. Like they do all over Europe.  With soda stream no more plastics! Just a reusable one that can be washed and reused over and over.  Do better and stop the darn plastics!!!!!!!","Jul 9, 2023",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6449320f946ada00125a1ffd

MARK LENICK,US,Thank you coke cola for saving me tons‚Ä¶,"Thank you coke cola for saving me tons of money now with my family, business, and colleagues, along with half the graduating seniors and college graduates. You did AWESOME for your trademark and I will now continue to promote what you said to EVERYONE I know.  For many years we have willingly paid a higher price for your product because it was a better product... Now because you want to jump on the band wagon of racism your done. So many other things in the world currently going on and your more concerned on how you could possibly make more money or get something out of this completely discusses me. BUT because ""coke cola"" says it, it must be true..... therefore that must now also mean I am entitled to all that has been going on to please the African Americans. Riots, fights, government checks, and without consequences.  I will say my entire family is MULTI race, MULTI gender, and without discrimination, or judgement.... therefore I certainly cannot be claimed as being ""TOO WHITE"" .... from a legal standpoint. I do believe that's discrimination.  Again, Coke Cola I cannot thank you enough, my lawyer is currently having a field day with this.  Remember the person who won a million from Mc Donald's over a hot cup of coffee......   that is a needle in the haystack compared to what you did.  ....  you have my info.. so goodluck. Ps... was just told I am able to give multiple reasoning and descriptive details how wrong this is... so I can, if asked, or will in a few days because your publication enforcing your solid logo has been tarnished in so many ways.  Again, I thank you Coke Cola for being the racist that the world has been trying to be rid of and making right again.  You NAILED it. Just caused a complete chaos on your own greedy financial benefit.  GREAT JOB on being a team player uniting the world. Granted, I do realize I am a simple peon in your eyes currently, but imagine how many people are going to read this over the course of the next week after its posted on as many sites as I can find bleeding ""Coke Cola"" out to be the United States TOP publicized racists while trying to unit the world.  This is YOUR guys doing, not the Americans regardless of race ...... I will continue to point this out from here on out. The world is a nation of people together, not a color, religion, or belief, yet ""COKE COLA"" is now betraying and trying to play sides on their own benefit literally for financial benefit for their own pocket allowing all Americans to turn against themselves based on a tv/ radio ads.  That's worse than a riot, racism, and now having their children grow up having these feelings against each other.  This is NOT helping AMERICA.... This promotion is embarrassing it and embracing it. I will be contacting the radio and as many advertisement againencies as possible.  America is United as 1 union under presidential rule.... at that point ""WHITE"" [as Coke cola says....not [caucasians] Hindu, Pakastinians, Jamaicans, Israelis, Philippinos, and yes African americans also.  Does ""Coke Cola"" realize that the world does consist of more than just 2 individual ""colors"" that purchase their product, yet they are trying to dominate an individual race.  Such bad marketing.  At that point anyone that does NOT FIT the ""PROFILE"" should shy away, because clearly they are NOT worthy to ""COCA COLAS"" product. Coke cola is only interested in what they are able to benefit from publicity and greed regardless what impact their publication does on the united states personal interests.  WOW..... what an eye opener.  This will be posted and let known in hope's no matter what your age, gender, sexuality, or race may be..... this is the type of nonsense  cancer affecting us as collaboration today.","Updated Mar 2, 2021",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/603d8b5033bbbc0019716d93

M Liaquat,GB,I was employed by CocaCola in 2019‚Ä¶,"I was employed by CocaCola in 2019 therefore i know the ill practise that goes on in the industry. Managers have favourite people not based on merit or capabilities. I did 3 people‚Äôs work all by myself for 6 months on 12 hour shifts. Operating hplc on regular basis and taking samples every 5-8 minutes.CocaCola used me for as long as they needed me and then sacked me because one employer kept on changing the hplc calibration every time i would leave the lab to make it more difficult for me.This had happened more then 3 times before and it was always the same person. Instead of catching out this person they blamed me for it when i wasn't even present in the lab. 2 managers joined forces to get me out. I put my 110% in this company and listened to a lot of abuse from others discrimination racist remarks the lot. I had more product being manufactured in my shift all by myself then other shifts. Red green and yellow shifts all had 3 people each to do this job however i had myself only. On an average shift i would walk 4-6 Km in 12 hrs. This resulted in huge blisters. However nothing i did had made any difference whatsoever the other person was friends with the manager therefore i was the one who was handed the wrong end of stick. The managers are involved in these bad practices and they are very quick to brush under the carpet mistakes made by their persoal. CocaCola likes to abuse its workers and then sack them. I would never recommend for a genuine person to work their. The mangers have been promoted passed their capabilities they haven‚Äôt a clue is to how to operate a hplc, gc or carl fisher, which is amazing to considering how they have come up to managers and team leaders. Not all of cocacola products are QC compliant and again managers are quick to cover up mistakes made by their friends. Which is unacceptable by any standards.

The message on their phone system is a lie, for there being an aluminum shortage lie.  Go into any grocery store and count the numerous boxes of coke and sprite to the point it will take up one to 2 entire aisles.  If they put that much care into other products (Mello Yello and Fresca) it would be on the shelf too.  They claim they don't want coke to be the next toilet paper.  HAHAHAHA!  What a joke.  Cleaning products are still in short supply but coke can be found everywhere.  The bottom line is they want to make the money the cleaning companies have been making throughout this pandemic and they are doing it at the expense of the people who buy their product trying to force them to buy coke which is horrible or sprite which is also not that great and they don't care about any of their other products because they don't bring in enough money for them apparently or so I have been told on numerous phone calls to complain.

Rhonda Meiners,US,Coke turned it's BACK on us,"Just would like everyone to know what the Coca-Cola Bottling Company did to me about a month ago I opened up a Coca Cola bottle went to take a drink and a big piece of glass went cutting down my throat and cut the back of my throat badly I was rushed to the hospital upon exiting the hospital I called Coca Cola be a loyal customer that I am and ask them to pay for my medical bills they called me they sent reps to my house then come at me with Coca Cola of mexico is to blame it wasn't America Coca Cola that was to blame it was Mexico Coca Cola co. that was to blame funny y'all both have the same trademark and logo but now Mexico Coca-Cola to blame right read the letter that I wrote below to Coca-ColaHelloI got to thinking about our phone conversation today and I like for you to understand the obvious. First, i don't have a problem handing over the bottle or anything else over to you along with the pictures and video but it will have to be at the same time as your  Co. Is either handing me over a monastery amount in a check form or direct deposit then YES the evidence is all yours. I know coca cola has reps here in San Antonio as ur Co. Does at every major city and i also know that theycould come over to my house and look at my evidence, get the label # themselves..and ve done simpke that easy....BUT I WILL NOT TURN IN THE BOTTLE in question UNTIL WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT ON PAYMENT and that is not negotiable.  Im in this for the long haul should your Co. Decide to c what im really made of.  I didbt ask for this injury but its ur companies failt that i was injured i am 100% sure about that. ILL GO AS HIGH UP IN the COCA COLA Co. AS I HAVE TO to be heard and to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.How ridiculous is this....WHAT If Coca Cola decides after I send in bottle in that... Nah...now that we have the bottle we are in the clear he can't prove it now. Common sense to the average person would say exactly what I am saying to your request and I think it's insulting for you to act like me not wanting to send you the bottle, my main piece of evidence in to you tomorrow by Fed Wx coming to get bottle is far fetched and ridiculous to say the least. ... not to mention kind of shady....Oh and isnt coca cola Mexico still part of the COCA cola Co. PERIOD.....Yes I think so...Listen, I have more then kept my side of the bargain here. I haven't gone hiring an attorney or going public to the news MEDIA.In fact  I Gave your Co. What most people in my situation would do The chance to settle this quietly before I went to the media and press about this and believe me this story will go out on the san antonio news as my brother in law is the main news anchor here on CBS at 5... I Gave your Co. THE CHANCE, AND Respect plus my loyalty to you because I've DRANK  your products not just Cokes for over 20+ years now ...ive been a loyal ,loyal purchaser and consumer since i was a child...I am however Seriously finding myself second guessing not only my decision to give ur Co. A chance first but I am second guessing your loyalty not only to me as a consumer  but also to the public at large as consumersI know your company has been sued At least in five occasions for this very thing (reference these cases)1. Pulley vs. Pacific coca cola award $2500 in 19662.1984 12 year old swallowed glass was award and found favor with COURT resulting in your Co. Paying his parents3.1994 Alabama Coca Cola vs.Parker Awarded $ 10,000 sec 2d 786.4514.2010 John Preston drank glass awarded undisclosed amount5.Andy Loft also was awarded money from COCA COLA for this very thing....and none of them had as much information and evidence as I do.Those were just the ones I found right away. So with that being said where do we now stand. I am not prepared to turn over evidence until we come to an agreement and I'm not wIlling to wait very much longer for your co. To decide if I truly am serious  about this issue and persuing it or if im in this dog fight for the long haul should Coca Cola now turns its back on me. Because the answer to that question is YES I AM.You made a statement to me yesterday did I know I was being recorded....  why you asked me that was a little off if you ask me but none the less I have nothing to hide,  and ive been forth right and truthful in every aspect of this since this ordeal began. So I guess I am now saying that either your company comes to me in the next day [friday] with an offer of atleast $10,000 to pay hospital bills and some pain and suffering aka cut throat, spitting up blood for days, unable ro eat for days, and going to Er to name just a few ... by the end of this week Sunday...then you can take to the bank....that you will be hearing COCA COLA name in the news. But You have the chance to stop that but only for the next day or two otherwise negotiations with Ur Co. Will be at conclusion. I'm sure you well know Once I go to attorney we both know I will not be able to speak with ur co. Again. It will then be to late...so Coca Cola what r u going to do? The ball is now in your COURT and I am saving this letter along with all other correspondence just as I've saved ALL evidence in this matter to submit to media as well. I wonder what the public would view  and say as to ur treatment of a loyal consumer...... such as myself and possubly to them as well.... it's up to CC?... Monday  will start a whole new chapter in this. Thank you and good day. I think I am being fair more then fair and i also think that it's a very small price to pay for pain and suffering to keep CC reputation where it's been for the past several years. Once again thank you.... if you can reach me then please call Rhonda my fiance at 210.815.4642..thank you.Anthony Cmielewski","May 26, 2017",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5928bcda0000ff000a9cd177
